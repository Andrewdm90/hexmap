# hexmap
Hex map generator / editor

Runs purely client-side via HTML / CSS / JS. Made with pure code-vibing AI madness as a bit of an experiment to see whether it was possible to write a program I wanted with barely any input. The only things I changed 'manually' were some HTML and CSS for useability and layout.

The controls are pretty straight forward. I would recommend not playing with the orientation / shape once it has generated. It won't lose any data if you do, but it will mis-align must stuff aside from hex colouring and look weird.

== FEATURES ==
COLURING: Change a hex to whatever colour you want, representing the terrain type. This uses the built-in colour pciker for your browser / OS.

ICONS: Import .svg format icons and stamp them onto your hexmap. Location is not bound to a hex, you can put them whereever you want, even between hexes if you want.

DRAWING: A 'pen tool' that lets you draw stuff onto your hexmap, again you can draw across or inbetween hexes if you want. Great for drawing rivers and roads etc.

TEXT: Add text to your hexmap, whereever you want it.

HEX NOTES: You can add notes to the hexes by clicking a hex number, which will come up with a small window for you to type in, then save. When a hex has a saved note, a small notebook emoji (ðŸ““) will appear next to the hex number. Good for keeping track of the names, history or facts about locations.

SAVING / LOADING: Saving and loading functionality is built in as well and appears to work very well. Imported icons are also saved along with the rest of the map data. I can't guarantee compatibility with an old save file if the site is updated, though I can't think of any more features I want to add that would break compatability at the moment.

== WIP ==
There is currently no map / notes export function, but I (I.e. the AI) will probably add that in at some point down the line. Until then you can screenshot the map and print it if need be.
